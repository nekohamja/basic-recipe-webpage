    <p>This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, 
        made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls 
        for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan. 
        I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.
